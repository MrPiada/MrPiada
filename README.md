# Hello World 👋
Born as a high-energy physics researcher [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/INSPIREhep-informational?style=flat&logo=inspirehep&logoColor=white&color=0c1c29)](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1905106), along the way I  realized that software development has been promoted from being a mere tool to becoming the real goal.

I enjoy developing and optimizing algorithms, as well as understanding the fine details of programming languages.

### Personal interests
* Former water polo player 🤽‍♂️, actual runner 🏃‍♂️ and cyclist 🚴‍♂️
* Enthusiast chess player ♟️
